YOUTUBE VIDEO ANALYSIS - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY
============================================================

ABSTRACT OVERVIEW
--------------------

I've been programming in. "I thought. This is everything you need to know about Java in 13 minutes. Programming languages are just a bunch.

[0:01:15] of key words and symbols that help us program a computer the one we're learning today is obviously. I made a video of installing eclipse on. Right click on the source folder and get a new class and this is just our. Java hit this first check mark public static void main and then hit finish and we get some code looking stuff pop up.

A programming language is just a bunch of key words and symbols and it looks like this. Java file already has some keywords cymbals in here for us a super useful thing we can do in. Storing data is super cool if we wanted to change our user name say on. Java parse it which just means go through and make sense of it all so that's why these weird little semicolons exist so now the name.

"I think it's really stupid because we're not done yet but after you have the name of your variable hit a period and this period. [0:05:00] is maybe one of the most important symbols in. Java in will most likely have like a little box here and you can scroll through it and this is everything you can do to that variable so one. There's this great piece of code to print out so you can see things it's called system dot out dot print line and then some parentheses.

In a window you should see your name to uppercase if. Method is a method that puts an exclamation mark say at the end of whatever string you want to start a method just write some keywords we're gonna write the keyword it's public static void don't worry too much about this right now they're just keywords and every keyword has its own purpose we'll name it like add. Since characters and strings anything that's not a number or a variable name has to be in quotation marks statements end in a semicolon we'll save it and run it. Use code from another.

6. One keyword is if this is called
7. If-else statements are super useful you can repeat code by doing a for loop
8. A for loop format has the keyword for some parenthesis and then a format that kind of looks like this in simple terms
9. This will repeat the code inside of here 5 times
